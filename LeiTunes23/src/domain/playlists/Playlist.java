/**

 *
 * Playlists have a name and consist of a list of distinct musics from a music library.
 * 
 * Removing a song from the library leads to automatic removal of the song from the 
 * playlist, if it is there.
 * 
 * Addition/removal of songs may be completely automatic and, hence, manual addition/removal 
 * might not be possible. The same applies to changes of order through moveUpSelected method.
 * 
 * At any time, one song in the playlist may be selected and one song of the 
 * playlist may be playing (i.e. the play action was performed via the playlist). 
 * A playlist keeps track that a song was played (until the end) through the playlist.
